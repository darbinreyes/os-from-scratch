# Bochs is a program that simulates a complete Intel x86 computer.
# ===
# * This is the bochs configuration file.
# * [Bochs User Manual](http://bochs.sourceforge.net/doc/docbook/user/index.html).
# * FYI:
#   * How do you pronounce "Bochs"? Phonetically the same as the English word "box".
#   * To quit bochs with keyboard -> CMD+CRTL, then press SPACE.
#   * for bochs installed with macports, ROM images are located at `/opt/local/share/bochs/`.
#   * for bochs built from source, `./bochs/bios/`.
