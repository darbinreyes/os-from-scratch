This project is my implementation of a simple operating system, originally
inspired by **Simple Operating System - from Scratch by Nick Blundell** and
**Operating System Concepts by Galvin**.

**PROJECT STATUS:**: Basic support for getting input from the keyboard. Keyboard input is echoed to the screen in kernel main(). TODO: Finish key code to ASCII conversion for non-ASCII keys. This project is **paused** while I work work on OS/161.
